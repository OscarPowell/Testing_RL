# Adversarial Attacks of Q-Learning and SARSA agents, Cart-Pole and Grid Environments
Some implementations of Q_Learning and SARSA on a Grid World and Open AI gym Cart-Pole environment for an Engineering Masters Project, while investigating the effect of attacks on these algorithms using man-in-the-middle
adversarial attacks. Found some techniques to lower the effectiveness of these attacks.
